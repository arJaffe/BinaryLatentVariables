# BinaryLatentVariables

The script 'main_estimate_weight_matrix.m' implements a spectral method for learning
a binary latent variable model. The method is described in 
the paper:
"Learning Binary Latent Variable Models: A Tensor Eigenpair Approach"
Authors: 
Ariel Jaffe, Roi Weiss, Shai Carmi, Yuval Kluger and Boaz Nadler (2018)
The output of the script is Figure 2 in the paper.

Acknowledgment: In the following code we use an implementation of
the Hungarian method, by Niclas Borlin, Department of Computing Science,
